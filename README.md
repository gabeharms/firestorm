firestorm
=========

A fork of the firestorm lgpl viewer from http://hg.phoenixviewer.com/phoenix-firestorm-lgpl/

This fork is only marginally modified from the normal firestrom viewer.  It has been changed in the following ways:

1 - It is now on git instead of mercurial
2 - It has MOSES specific icons and skin
3 - It connects to the MOSES grid by default, with other grid options removed by default

This client is for MOSES use and development.  If you are looking for an excellent viewer for your own, or for other grids, please visit www.firestorm.org and download the official firestorm viewer.
