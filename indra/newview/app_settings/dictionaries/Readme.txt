This folder is no longer used when packaging.  It is only used when running from an IDE.  

To populate the spell check dropdown, copy the files from (build directory)\packages\dictionaries to here.

To add/make permanent changes to the dictionaries that ship with the viewer, you will need to make a new autobuild package, see http://hg.secondlife.com/3p-dictionaries .
