 * The Voice Control Panel is an ambient window summoned by clicking the flyout chevron on the Speak button.
 * It can be torn-off and freely positioned onscreen.
 *
 * When the Resident is engaged in Nearby Voice Chat, the Voice Control Panel provides control over 
 * the Resident's own microphone input volume, the audible volume of each of the other participants,
 * the Resident's own Voice Morphing settings (if she has subscribed to enable the feature), and Voice Recording.
 *
 * When the Resident is engaged in any chat except Nearby Chat, the Voice Control Panel also provides an 
 * 'Leave Call' button to allow the Resident to leave that voice channel.
