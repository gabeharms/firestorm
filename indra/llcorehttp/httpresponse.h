/// HttpResponse is instantiated by the library and handed to

/// all the status, header and HTTP body data the caller is
/// interested in.  Methods provide simple getters to return
/// individual pieces of the response.
///
/// Typical usage will have the caller interrogate the object
/// and return from the handler callback.  Instances are refcounted
/// and callers can bump the count and retain the object as needed.
///
/// Threading:  Not intrinsically thread-safe.
///
/// Allocation:  Refcounted, heap only.  Caller of the constructor
/// is given a refcount.
