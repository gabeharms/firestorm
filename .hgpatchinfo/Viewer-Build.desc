[Viewer/Build]
- changed : compiler options for "Release with Debug" builds
- changed : compiler and linker options for "Release" builds
- changed : removed LL's changeset tags and added new (consistent) SL-X.Y.Z tags for releases
- changed : break into the debugger rather than forcing the process into an unrecoverable state for "llerrs" on non-release builds
    -> Windows only
- changed : set the "FMOD" flag to TRUE for the (Windows) ReleaseOS build configuration
- changed : set the "UNATTENDED" flag to FALSE for all (Windows) *OS build configurations
- changed : updated OpenJPEG package with debug information for crash debugging
- fixed   : *OS builds don't set the default Visual Studio project and configuration
- fixed   : libpng is built with "Whole Program Optimization" and causing slow linker performance
    -> "MSIL .netmodule or module compiled with /GL found; restarting link with /LTCG; add /LTCG to the link command line to improve linker performance"
    -> causes the linker to abort the current run and start over
- fixed   : viewer fails to compile with only the Windows 8 SDK installed
- fixed   : viewer won't compile when bison v2.7.1 is installed
