- fixed : "Worn items in Viewer 2 and Viewer 1.x aren't synchronized" (http://jira.secondlife.com/browse/VWR-17594)
    -> current fix compares *only* the wearables in COF with the wearables specified by AgentWearablesUpdate
- fixed : minor memory leak in LLInitialWearablesFetch::processWearablesMessage()
